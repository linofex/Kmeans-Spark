# Kmeans-Spark

Cloud Computing Project regarding Big Data Processing module.

This project and the [ "K-means-Hadoop"](https://github.com/lossi771/K-means-Hadoop/) are part of the same Cloud Computing Project for Big Data Processing whose specification can be found in the PDF file [ "Kmeans Specs"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/Kmeans%20Specs.pdf)

["kmeans.py"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/kmeans.py) implements the required specification.
 
The ["generate_points.py"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/generate_points.py) is the script related to the dataset generation according to Section 1.1. inside the [ "report"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/report.pdf). The latter contains other useful information and a short description of the most relevant feature of this project.
